# Macros

## Convert macros to modules

Converting a macro to Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code can enable certain actions to run faster.

To convert a macro to VBA, select the macro (don't open it, just select it) and, in the `Database Tools` tab click on `Convert Macros to Visual Basic`.

Then, once done, you'll probably need to update your interface: if you've forms, you'll need to update f.i. buttons to fire the VBA module and no more the macros.

If everything goes fine, just delete the converted macros.
